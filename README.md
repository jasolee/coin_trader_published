Cryptocurrency Coin Trader
==========================

Software developed by Jason Lee & Thomas Smith in 2017 as a personal project
during the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. Coin Trader is a cryptocurrency arbitrage
tracker and trading program that scrapes the web for coin-pair arbitrages
and trades according to the path of maximized profit. Coin-pair arbitrages
at the time of the Bitcoin bubble were up to 20% (i.e. the same cryptocurrency
sold for 20% more in South Korea vs the US). Coin Trader utilized APIs from
several different cryptocurrency wallet and trading platforms to make these
trades while scraping the web using a cron job and a urllib parser.
